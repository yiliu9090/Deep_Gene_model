# Deep Gene model
## Introduction: 

Deep Gene is a coding project that I want to embark on for large scale computational study of Transcription Model using Deep Neural Network. This project comes after I have decided to work on the paper 'Fully Interpretable Deep Learning Model of Transcriptional Control' which is published in ISMB and Bioinformics.  The full purpose of Deep Gene is to design a code that automatically generates transcription control DNNs so that we can conduct ABC style inferences. The backend of this DNN is Tensorflow 2.2.0. This is an upgrade from the implementation in Liu, et. (2020) which uses Tensorflow 1.11.0 and Keras 1.0. We will continue to focus on the running and maintainance of Tensorflow in the future. At the moment, this code should be OS independent. 

A actual mathematical model of Transcriptional Control is fundementally very different from that of an ordinary Deep Learning Project. This model is strongly interpretable and therefore has a rather restrictive structure. In the design of this code, much care is taken from the initial input data to output
